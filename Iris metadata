Her skills include charming targets, assassination, and excellent disguise.\n\nIris holds a rather fancy weapon, a cane, that can transform into different objects, but her favorite is to wield a rope and a sword with it. She can toy with any target's feelings so be careful not to get caught in her charms.",
